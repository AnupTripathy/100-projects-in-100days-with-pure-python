name1 = "Jack"
#1name is wrong X. We can't use any number in the beginning of a var name
name_two = "Harry" # We can use "_" at any place we want.
#name-two is wrong X. We can't use space or - sign in var name
nameThree = "Ron" #camelCase

_name_4 = input("What is your name?") #valid

print(_name_4)
